# python_challenge
A simple script that connects to the IBM X-Force API and returns human
readable results about a specified IP address.

# setup
In order to use this script, no additional package installation is
required. Before you can use this script to make calls to the X-Force
Exchange API, you must create a valid configuration file. In order to
do that, you'll need to change the name of "iprep_conf.py.CHANGEME"
to "iprep_conf.py" and add your own personal API keys to the "xfex_cred"
value. Those keys need to be formatted as "<api_key>:<api_secret>".
